            <h2>The impact of ChatGPT in education:</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT has made a strong impression among teachers and students for its quick and accurate responses that has caused concerns around school nations surrounding the cheating scandals. However, there has been a shift in how educators could take advantage of the chatbot despite the cheating issues that could help overturn them. For example, educators could write prompts in ChatGPT to help with their organization plan by having the technology create lesson plans, learning activities, discussion prompts, etc. In addition, ChatGPT recommends teaching methods to develop activities that are widely accessible for students to get involved.</p>

            <h2>ChatGPT in companies:</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is not only often used by normal users, but also by corporations to help in smoothly operating their products and services. For example, Duolingo is an application created to help users learn a new language without the need of a human tutor. Recently, it added a feature operated by GPT-4 which is tied with ChatGPT’s corporation, that allows users to improve their language skills by practicing with AI personas, where each persona carries a personality and background in exposure for users to learn.</p>

            <h2>Complexities Surrounding ChatGPT:</h2>
            <p>In the light of ChatGPT’s great advantages to saving time and stress for users in completing their daily priorities, it could also provide harm to users. In the education sector as mentioned, the use of ChatGPT has been a tool students would benefit from in cheating in order to get an assignment done accurately and quickly. It could later on grow out of hand if the chat box is not used properly and controlled, ruining the learning experiences for students to expand their knowledge and critical thinking skills. Jumping from how ChatGPT is utilized in corporations or companies such as Duolingo, there are some flaws that wouldn’t provide the most accurate responses to users as it is trained on the information given to its responses and if the information needed to respond is not included, the chatbot would not stop itself from giving away an answer to their users in continuing their services.</p>
